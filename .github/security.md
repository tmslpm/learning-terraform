# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Handling

This project is a template (boilerplate) designed to provide a development foundation. 
It does not follow versioning conventions but relies on external dependencies that are 
regularly updated via [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically).

### User Responsibilities

- Keep dependencies up to date using tools like `Dependabot` or `Maven Dependency Plugin`.
- Report any vulnerabilities found in the template code as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

- Open a **GitHub Issue** and provide:
- - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
- - Any suggestions or potential fixes.

## Notes

- Vulnerabilities in the dependencies (e.g., Spring, JDA, etc.) should be reported directly to their maintainers.
- This template is actively maintained, but users are responsible for configuring and adapting it to meet their specific needs.
